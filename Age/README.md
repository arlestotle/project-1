Project Title: A decadal survey on the impact of various factors on homelessness in the USA (2010-2020)

Team Members: Alexandra Turner, Arle Alcid, Beauty Simora, Isha Chaware, & Nancy Ulloa

Project Description/Outline: Homelessness is a complex and pressing issue that affects millions of individuals and families in the United States. To better understand the evolving nature of homelessness and formulate effective policies and strategies, a comprehensive decadal survey is proposed to examine the impact of various factors on homelessness in the USA from 2010 to 2020. This survey will provide crucial insights into the causes and dynamics of homelessness, enabling policymakers, researchers, and service providers to develop evidence-based interventions and policies.

Research Questions to Answer: 
1.	To what extent does the presence of welfare programs correlate with reduced rates of homelessness?
2.	How are natural disasters impacting homelessness?
3.	What are the demographic characteristics of the homeless population?
4.	How does substance abuse affect homelessness?
5.	What is count of veterans experiencing homelessness?
